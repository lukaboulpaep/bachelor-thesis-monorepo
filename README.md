# About this project

This project will be about my bachelor thesis that I have write in my last year of university. I'm a student at Odisee and I study computer science, during my last semester I will have gone through my internship as a cloud developper and the subject of my thesis will be going along with the subject of my internship.

The thesis will be about how to develop an API Gateway in Golang and how to implement some security measures such as Authentication and Authorization, how to avoid a single point of failure and how to deploy this in the cloud.

This repository is mainly made for me to keep track of my research and documentation and my implementation of this research. But the choice of making this public is because this information could be helpful to another student or another person, and people are also free the leave out comments to make improvements about my choices or the way I have written an implementation.

## Where can you find my decision making?

There will be a folder in this repository where you can find all of my documentation. The readme in that folder will help you find the right document for the information you would be looking for.

You will see what my thought process was during the making of this thesis, what sources I have used to make my decsisions upon and some documentation of how the API Gateway is made and some of the microservices.
