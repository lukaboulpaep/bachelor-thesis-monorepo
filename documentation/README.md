# Documentation

This folder holds the information about my documentation, you can find anything from decision making, research to structure of code and explanation of maybe some more complex topics that I have written down.

## Research phase

All documents listed below are about my research phase before I knew anything about API Gateways and what exactly the scope of my thesis will be.
